# UN-Sustainable-E-Waste-Management-System
The Corporate E-Waste Monitor Database System is a data-driven platform designed to monitor, analyze, and flag electronic waste (e-waste) generated by companies. It addresses overproduction and overconsumption by linking corporate reporting to automated compliance checks and environmental thresholds.

**[Features]**

Automated Flagging: Companies are automatically flagged for excessive e-waste, missing reports, or inconsistent data.
E-Waste Tracking: Stores both estimated and reported e-waste for analysis.
Variance Analysis: Calculates differences between estimated and reported e-waste.
Reporting & Visualization: Supports dashboards and data export (CSV, PDF).
Sustainability Insights: Provides information to encourage responsible consumption and disposal.
Scalable & Secure: Built with normalized relational tables, foreign key constraints, and triggers.


**[Database Schema]**

Companies – company details and active status
Estimated E-Waste – projected e-waste per company/year
Reported E-Waste – official reported e-waste data
Flagged Companies – tracks companies violating thresholds
Views & Triggers – automate flagging and calculate variances
